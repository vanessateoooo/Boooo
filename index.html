            Here's a bit of a throwback event. In case you're wondering, the day where I started this website and/or this project for you
            was the day where Demetrius came over to my place. LOL do you remember you texting me in such a cold manner asking me to be mindful of the time??
            I wasn't sad or tacken aback but I was more bothered at the fact that this is bothering you D: I'm sorry!!!!!!
            Just want to say that I know it's not very respectful or appropriate to have a guy over so late at night but here's a backstory!!
            When he was teaching me how to code and giving me ideas for projects, I actually opened a screenshot picture of us videocalling and started to profess my
            love for you to him :O. Crazy, I know. Cringe, I also know T.T
            Tapi I sayang you POLL and I make it a point to say that to (most) of the guys I hang out w!
